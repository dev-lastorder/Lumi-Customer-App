## Purpose of the `globalComponent` File

The `globalComponent` file is used to define and manage components that are shared across multiple parts of the application. By centralizing commonly used components, we promote code reusability, maintain consistency in the user interface, and simplify updates or bug fixes. This approach also helps in reducing code duplication and makes the application easier to maintain and scale.


Example In this app:
    ProductDetailModal
    ConfirmationModal
